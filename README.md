# go-habit
A REST API for individual users to track habits. Not a finished project and likely won't be. Just a fun little educational project to learn more about REST APIs and Golang.

## Future Todos and Ideas
- Better error checking and consistent messages
- Profile editing
- Better organization and some code cleanup
- Swagger 2.0 docs

### Authentication
- User login and logout
- Session tracking
- User permissions

### Frontend
- Start work on a frontend system (react or vue?)
